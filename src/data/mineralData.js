        notes: `It belongs to the order of beryls, in most found samples it is a blue or blue-green mineral, in the Mohs hardness table beryls are around 7.5-8. Aquamarine has the ability to disperse light, so when the optical axis changes, it changes from blue to an almost colorless shade. it consists mostly of oxygen and silicon, with a smaller part of aluminum and beryllium.`,
